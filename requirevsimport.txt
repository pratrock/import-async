require is the default way of loading the modules from another file.
Require is synchronous operation which means the code below require will not be executed until the module has been loaded. 
Which is why if you're loading a module and using it, import before using.
Require is part of common js 
Require generally loads the entire modules in a file at once.

Import is part of ES6 modules. It can be initialized in node js by setting type="module" in package.json.
Import is asynchronous and the code after import can also be executed.
Import is not default module of node.js, it can be used by using extension .mjs
Import can also import individual functions within a file.
